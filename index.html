      Artificial intelligence is reshaping the world. From self-driving cars to
      voice assistants, machines are learning faster than ever. The future
      belongs to those who can adapt, innovate, and build. Programming is not
      just about writing code; itâ€™s about solving real-world problems
      efficiently. Every great developer once started with simple lines of code,
      improving each day. Consistency and patience lead to mastery.
